	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), is a meshfree, Lagrangian, particle method, which is advantageous over conventional grid-based numerical methods in the aspect of interface treatment. Therefore, it has shown promising potential for simulating the multiphase flow problems. Over the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to the simulation of the multiphase flow by using the SPH method. In this review, recent advances in SPH for simulating the multiphase flow are reviewed. Firstly, the basic concept of SPH is briefly introduced. Attention is then paid to how to treat the pressure of incompressible flow, boundary condition and the surface tension in SPH. In addition, modeling free surface flow is briefly introduced. The modified interfacial models and their applications in handling high density ratio are addressed. Finally, a summary of SPH in the application of the multiphase flow is given.},

In the PF-SPH model, the Navier–Stokes equations are discretized with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, and the Young–Laplace boundary condition at the fluid–fluid interface and the Young boundary condition at the fluid–fluid–solid interface are replaced with pairwise forces added into the Navier–Stokes equations. We derive a relationship between the parameters in the pairwise forces and the surface tension and static contact angle. Next, we demonstrate the model's accuracy under static and dynamic conditions. Finally, we use the Pf-SPH model to simulate three phase flow in a porous medium.},

We introduce a new Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method for simulating three dimensional fluid-solid interaction flows with capillary (wetting and surface tension) effects at free surfaces. This meshless approach presents significant advantages over grid based approaches in terms of being monolithic and in handling interaction with free solids. The method is validated for accuracy and stability in dynamic scenarios involving surface tension and wetting. We then present three dimensional simulations of crown forming instability following the splash of a liquid drop, and the rupture of a liquid bridge between two colliding solid spheres, to show the method’s advantages in the study of dynamic micromechanical phenomena involving capillary flows.},

The method is easy to use, and examples will be given of its application to a breaking dam, a bore, the simulation of a wave maker, and the propagation of waves towards a beach. Arbitrary moving boundaries can be included by modelling the boundaries by particles which repel the fluid particles. The method is explicit, and the time steps are therefore much shorter than required by other less flexible methods, but it is robust and easy to program.},

	title = {A {Highly}-{Scalable} {Implicit} {SPH} {Code} for {Simulating} {Single}- and {Multi}-phase {Flows} in {Geometrically} {Complex} {Bounded} {Domains}},
	abstract = {We present 3D pore-scale simulations of multi-phase ﬂows in a porous medium using a consistent smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. Unlike grid-based Lagrangian methods, classical SPH formulations are trivially scalable but introduce stiﬀ timestep restrictions and are inconsistent with the governing equations. The present work recovers consistency by using local compact corrections to achieve second order spatial convergence with less overall interprocessor communication. We use an implicit projection scheme to implement the continuum surface force model for multi-phase ﬂow. To achieve a scalable implementation, an interface between two high-performance libraries has been developed: LAMMPS to handle discretization and particle dynamics, and Trilinos to solve the discretized equations using algebraic multigrid. The resulting approach has been demonstrated to scale to more than 150 million particles on 11k cores. Benchmarks demonstrating the accuracy of the method and large scale single-phase and two-phase simulations are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the code.},
